	<h1>Policies</h1>

	<h2>Absentee Policy</h2>
	<p>You can miss <b>up to four (4) lectures</b>; after that, your job placement is forfeit. I don't recommend missing any, as we will be moving very fast.</p>
	<p>If you have special circumstances, please speak with your instructor or campus director to see if we can find an acceptable solution.</p>
	
	<h2>Late Homework Policy</h2>
	<p>Your homework is due by <b>8:00am</b> on the day it is due. After that, it is late. Like the absence policy, you can turn in homework late four (4) times, although I do not recommend it.</p>
	<p>I would rather see a solid attempt on time than a complete assignment late. Solid attempts are not considered late.</p>

	<h2>Honor Code</h2>
	<p>You are expected to do your own work. You should use all resources available to you, including open-source code, but merely copy and pasting open-source code or blatantly replicating existing designs is prohibited: you should use the work of others only for inspiration or as a library in a bigger project.</p>
	<p>Plagarism in homework is taken very seriously and can result in forfeiting job placement.</p>

	<h2>Code of Conduct</h2>
	<p>Like the technical community as a whole, classes at The Iron Yard are made up of a mixture of people from all different backgrounds.</p>
	<p>Diversity is one of our huge strengths, but it can also lead to communication issues and unhappiness. To that end, we have a few ground rules that we ask people to adhere to when they're taking a class at The Iron Yard. These rules apply equally to teachers, students, other staff, and guest lecturers.</p>
	<p>This isn't an exhaustive list of things that you can't do. Rather, take it in the spirit in which it's intended - a guide to make it easier to enrich all of us, the technical communities in which we participate.</p>
	<p>This code of conduct applies to all communication: this includes in class, HipChat, email, and other forums such as Skype, Twitter, Facebook, etc.</p>
	<p>If you believe someone is violating the code of conduct, we ask that you report it by talking to your teacher. If you do not feel comfortable talking to your teacher, speak with any Iron Yard teacher or campus director.</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Be welcoming, friendly, and patient.</li>
		<li>Be considerate. Your work will be used by other people, and you in turn will depend on the work of others. Any decision you make will affect your colleagues, and you should take those consequences into account when making decisions.</li>
		<li>Be respectful. Not all of us will agree all the time, but disagreement is no excuse for poor behavior and poor manners. We might all experience some frustration now and then, but we cannot allow that frustration to turn into a personal attack. It's important to remember that a community where people feel uncomfortable or threatened is not a productive one. Members of the Iron Yard community should be respectful when dealing with other members as well as with people outside the Iron Yard community.</li>
		<li>Be careful in the words that you choose. Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down other people. Behave professionally. Remember that harassment and sexist, racist, or exclusionary behaviors are not appropriate for this class. This includes, but is not limited to:
		<ul>
			<li>Violent threats or language directed against another person.</li>
			<li>Sexist, racist, or otherwise discriminatory jokes and language.</li>
			<li>Posting sexually explicit or violent material.</li>
			<li>Personal insults, especially those using racist or sexist terms.</li>
			<li>Unwelcome sexual attention.</li>
			<li>Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior.</li>
			<li>Repeated harassment of others. In general, if someone asks you to stop, then stop.</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
		<li>When we disagree, we try to understand why. Disagreements, both social and technical, happen all the time and The Iron Yard is no exception. It is important that we resolve disagreements and differing views constructively. Remember that we're different. The strength of The Iron Yard comes from its varied members, people from a wide range of backgrounds. Different people have different perspectives on issues. Being unable to understand why someone holds a viewpoint doesn't mean that they're wrong. Don't forget that it is human to err and blaming each other doesn't get us anywhere, rather offer to help resolve issues and to help learn from mistakes.</li>
