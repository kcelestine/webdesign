	<h1>Pre-work</h1>
	<p>There are a few things you do to prepare before class arrives. If you have trouble with anything on this list, don't worry, we will cover everything in depth in class if you get stuck.</p>
	<p>Let's get started!</p>

	<h2>Set Up Your Workstation</h2>

	<ol>
		<li>
			<h3>Get a Mac.</h3>
			<p>Any modern Macbook Air or Macbook Pro with at least 4GB or RAM will do.</p>
		</li>

		<li>
			<h3>Sign up for Adobe Creative Cloud.</h3>
			<p><a href="https://creative.adobe.com/plans">https://creative.adobe.com/plans</a></p>
			<p>You can pay for a full year or per month. You can also take advantage of the 30-day trial. We will use Photoshop, Illustrator, and TypeKit extensively, and likely a few other tools like InDesign. All of these tools are available with your Creative Cloud subscription. If you own an earlier version of these tools from version CS5, that is acceptable. Be sure to install Photoshop and Illustrator before class begins.</p>
		</li>

		<li>
			<h3>Download Sublime Text.</h3>
			<p><a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/">http://www.sublimetext.com/</a></p>
			<p>Sublime Text is a code editor that we will use in class. You may evaluate it for free, but purchasing a license will remove the nag screen that appears often. This editor is exteremly configurable, and we will load some essential features once class begins.</p>
		</li>

		<li>
			<h3>Install Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox.</h3>
			<p><a href="http://www.google.com/chrome/">http://www.google.com/chrome/</a><br>
			<a href="http://www.firefox.com/">http://www.firefox.com/</a></p>
			<p>Part of creating great websites is making sure that your code works in every major browser. Your Mac comes with Safari, and we will use Chrome extensively for building our websites, and test in Firefox to be sure our sites look great there, too.</p>
		</li>
	</ol>


	<h2>Pre-Work</h2>
	<ol>
		<li>
			<h3>Photoshop Training</h3>
			<p><a href="https://helpx.adobe.com/photoshop/tutorials.html">https://helpx.adobe.com/photoshop/tutorials.html</a></p>
			<p>Required: Watch everything under the Get Started and Learn Essentials sections.</p>
			<p>(You may skip the sections on Adobe Bridge and Camera Raw if you like - we will not be using those tools in this course.)</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<h3>Illustrator Training</h3>
			<p><a href="https://helpx.adobe.com/illustrator/tutorials.html">https://helpx.adobe.com/illustrator/tutorials.html</a></p>
			<p>Required: Watch everything under the Get Started and Learn Essentials sections.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<h3>HTML and CSS Training</h3>
			<p><a href="http://www.codecademy.com/en/tracks/web">http://www.codecademy.com/en/tracks/web</a></p>
			<p>Required: Complete this course, which includes a basic introduction to HTML and CSS.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<h3>Answer the following in your own words:</h3>
			<ol>
				<li>Explain the difference between Photoshop and Illustrator. What is the purpose of each program?</li>
				<li>Provide an example of a situation where it would be best to use a vector-based image.</li>
				<li>Provide an example of a situation where it would be best to use a pixel-based image.</li>
				<li>List several ways you can select a part of an image in Photoshop.</li>
				<li>Explain how vector points and lines work in Illustrator.</li>
			</ol>
		</li>
	</ol>
	<p>There are many of tasks and learning topics that are necessary to become a successful Web Designer and Front-End Developer. While we will spend the majority of our time learning web development, we simply do not have enough time in class to cover everything. Mastery of some standard design tools, like Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator, only comes with practice. I will be available throughout the course to assist with any issues, but being familiar with the basic tools before you arrive will be a huge benefit.</p>
	<ul>
		<li>I've assigned a series of videos on Photoshop and Illustrator for you to watch before class begins. I encourage you to pay close attention to these introductory videos, and to open Photoshop and Illustrator and experiment with these programs. Follow along with the videos, create your own images, and get a feel for the tools. Don't worry about understanding everything, we will cover many items in more detail once class begins. Just familiarize yourself with the interface, and arrive in class with a basic understanding of what each tool is used to create.</li>
		<li>I've also assigned some step-by-step HTML and CSS tutorials on a website called Codecademy. The languages of HTML and CSS will be at the core of every project that we build. Again, don't worry about mastering everything now, because we will cover these features in greater detail in class. The important thing now is that you understand what these languages do, and recognize them as we dive deeper in the first few days of the course.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Please do not rush through these examples. Use this opportunity to get a head start on your new career. I will assume that you have completed this work before class, so you will likely feel very far behind if you haven’t finished when we dive in on January 5th.</p>
	<p>Here’s to an exciting 2015!</p>
